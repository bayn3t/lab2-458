For this project, I looked at three search terms. They were all related, but each represents a different model of road bike groupsets.

- [Dura Ace 7700](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dura+ace+7700)  
- [Dura Ace 7400](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dura+ace+7400)  
- [Dura Ace 7200](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dura+ace+7200)  

For context, these terms refer to different generations of Shimano's high-end road bike groupsets. I chose to compare them because I am very involved with bikes as a hobby and sport, and I wanted to explore how people talk about different components online.

### Comparison of Word Clouds

The word clouds reveal some interesting differences in how people discuss each groupset:  

- The **7700 groupset** focuses on terms like "shimano", "ultra", "lightweight", and "performance", which reflects its popularity among road bike enthusiasts and racers.  
- The **7400 groupset** emphasizes terms such as "vintage", "classic", and "durability", showing that discussions often center around maintaining or restoring older bikes.  
- The **7200 groupset** includes words like "early", "reliability", and "upgrade", indicating that conversations often involve historical context or people transitioning from this older model.  

Overall, the main difference is that the newer models are discussed more in terms of performance, while the older models attract attention for maintenance, upgrades, and nostalgia.

### Possible Reasons for Patterns

These patterns likely arise because of the audience and purpose of the discussions:  

- Newer groupsets (7700) are still actively used in racing and high-performance cycling, so discussions focus on features and performance.  
- Older groupsets (7400, 7200) are more likely to appear in restoration projects or among collectors, so discussions highlight reliability and maintenance.

### Improvements / Future Research

Future research could be improved by:  

- Collecting more videos per search term to increase the sample size.  
- Including additional groupsets or components for a broader comparison.  
- Tracking changes over time to see how conversations about each groupset evolve.  

---

### Surprising Findings

Some terms unexpectedly overlapped between the older and newer groupsets. For example, even in discussions about the 7200, people occasionally referenced performance aspects typical of the 7700. This shows that enthusiasts often compare multiple generations in the same conversation.
